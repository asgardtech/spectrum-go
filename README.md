## Design Principles

Our implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Consistent API Design**: Every component follows the same patterns and style:
   - Type definitions for variants and constants
   - Struct representing the component with all properties
   - Constructor function named after the component
   - Fluent interface with method chaining
   - Render method that creates the web component with attributes

2. **Strong Typing**: Container components (like Tags and Accordion) accept only valid child component types for type safety.

3. **Default Values**: Components provide sensible defaults (size, treatment, etc.) while allowing customization.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component is self-contained in its own file.

5. **Slot Management**: Components that accept slotted content provide clear APIs for setting those elements.

6. **Event Handling**: Components use `app.EventHandler` for proper event binding.

7. **Attribute Mapping**: Proper mapping between Go properties and HTML attributes, maintaining Adobe Spectrum naming conventions.
